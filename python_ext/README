This is an example of how to write a Python Extention in C.

The YNN_core.c contains the C function definitions, and the YNN.c contains the
Pyhton interface.

All the methods defines in YNN_methods in the YNN.c file are available from
Python.

Compilation:
------------

	# python setup build


Running tests:
--------------

	# cp build/LIBRARY_DIR/LIB.so .
	# python test.py

See test.py for more info on how to use the extension.
